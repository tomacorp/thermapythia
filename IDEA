A stackup with a layer order is really just a model.
It can be edited as such, and have a name like a regular model.
It can refer to external or internal models such as materials.

What is different from a spice model is that it probably has some sort
of file order that determines layer order. But this could also be
done with indexes (which don't have to been evenly spaced integers).
Of course the natural order in the file would be the same as the indexes.

The important things are:
  Have a clean ascii representation that is easy to human edit and machine parse.
  Draw a good picture of the stackup. Use SVG.
  Be expressive enough to hold all the needed data.

Of lesser importance:
  Have a modern user interface with the latest jqueryui, json-editor or whatever technology.

Other models such as resistors are similar to stackups.
They are needed to create clean parametric representations of a family of parts.
